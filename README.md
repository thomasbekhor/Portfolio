## Projects

### [Sales Dashboard with Power BI](https://github.com/FernandoBichuette/Portfolio/tree/main/PowerBI)

**Description:** This project involved the creation of an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI. The goal was to transform raw data into clear and informative visual insights, covering various sales metrics such as total revenue, regional performance, and trend analysis over time.

**Technologies Used:** Power BI, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence

**Challenges and Solutions:**

* **Data Transformation:** One of the main challenges was cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. Various transformations were applied to ensure data accuracy and consistency, including removing duplicates, handling null values, and formatting dates.
* **Creating Impactful Visuals:** Creating visuals that were both informative and visually appealing was essential. Using Power BI's advanced features, dynamic and interactive charts were developed to facilitate data understanding.
* **Report Automation:** Implementation of DAX functions to automate metric calculations and create reports that update automatically as data changes.

**Results:** The final dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales, allowing users to explore data interactively and gain valuable insights into sales performance across regions and periods. This project demonstrated advanced skills in Power BI, including data manipulation and effective visualization creation.
