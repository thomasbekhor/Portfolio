### [Junior Consulting Club - Exploratory Analysis and Predictive Modeling - December 2022](https://github.com/thomasbekhor/Exploratory-and-Predictive-Analysis)

**Description:**
This project focuses on understanding and predicting property prices in São Paulo through **exploratory data analysis** and **machine learning**. The main goal is to extract insights from real estate data and build models that can forecast property values effectively.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Data Visualization

**Challenges and Solutions:**

* **Data Segmentation:** Divided and analyzed the dataset by key variables (e.g., neighborhood, size, price range) to identify trends and improve model performance.
* **Model Selection:** Tested multiple machine learning models, comparing their accuracy and interpretability. Chose Random Forest for its balance between performance and robustness.

**Results:**
The final model accurately predicts housing prices and reveals valuable patterns in São Paulo’s real estate market, supporting better decision-making for buyers, sellers, or investors.
